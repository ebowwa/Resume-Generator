# Resume Generator

## Overview
This is a simple resume generator tool that was created in response to Figma's decision to remove the dev mode feature for free users. The tool allows users to generate a clean and professional-looking resume without the need for advanced design skills.

## Features
- **White Text for LLM Prompt Injection**: The resume template uses white text, which makes it easy to inject prompts for large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. This allows users to generate personalized resume content with the help of AI.
- **Simple and Intuitive Interface**: The tool has a straightforward and user-friendly interface, making it easy for anyone to create a resume.
- **Customizable Templates**: Users can choose from a variety of pre-designed templates to suit their personal style and preferences.
- **Easy Editing**: The tool allows users to easily edit and customize their resume, including adding their own content and formatting.
- **Downloadable Output**: Once the resume is created, users can download it in a high-quality format for printing or sharing.

## Getting Started
