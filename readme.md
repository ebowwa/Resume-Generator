## Overview
This is a simple resume generator tool that was created in response to Figma's decision to remove the dev mode feature for free users. The tool allows users to generate a clean and professional-looking resume without the need for advanced design skills.

## Features
- **White Text for LLM Prompt Injection**: The resume template uses white text, which makes it easy to inject prompts for large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT that employers may be utilizing for hiring processes.
- **Easy Editing**: The tool allows users to easily edit and customize their resume, including adding their own content and formatting.
- **Downloadable Output**: Once the resume is created, users can download it in a high-quality format for printing or sharing.
